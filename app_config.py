ABOUT_PROJECT = """ Blur detection, as the name suggests, 
is the process of detecting whether an image is blurry or not.
Possible applications of blur detection include: 
Automatic image quality grading Helping professional photographers sort through 
100s to 1000s of photos.
After a photo shoot by automatically discarding the blurry/low quality ones. 
We will use Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Algorithm to perform blur detection.
